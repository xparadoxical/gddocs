# RS, UUID and UDID

These are the parameters that can be frequently noticed when sending a request.

## RS

RS stands for Random Seed, or Random String, which is essentially just a string containing *n* (often *10*) random alphanumeric characters.
RS is mainly sent as `rs` in requests.

Generating RS is quite simple:

### **Python**

```py
import random
from string import ascii_letters, digits  # so we don't have to type [A-Za-z0-9] by hand

# this code works only on python 3.6 and above

possible_letters = ascii_letters + digits


def generate_rs(n: int) -> str:
    return ("").join(random.choices(possible_letters, k=n))
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

## UUID

[UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) stands for Universally Unique IDentifier.
It has format of `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeee` and used to be sent as `uuid` in requests, but now the player ID (not to be confused with the account ID) is sent in its place instead.

It can be randomly generated using our `generate_rs()` function:

### **Python**

```py
def generate_uuid(parts: [int] = (8, 4, 4, 4, 10)) -> str:
    # apply generate_rs to each number in parts, then join results
    return ("-").join(map(generate_rs, parts))
```

## UDID

[UDID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDID) is an abbreviation for Unique Device IDentifier that is sent as `udid` in requests.

On Android, your UDID is generated by making a UUIDv4 from your SSAID (`Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID`). However, there's a common bug with the SSAID returning the value `9774d56d682e549c` on multiple devices. If the SSAID matches that string, a random UUIDv4 is generated instead. What's interesting is that the UDID on Android is one of the few parts of the Java code, so it's easily decompilable.

On Windows, the game tries to obtain either the thread or the process [SID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-identifiers) and removes all the dashes from it, which is a really long number starting with `S`. If it fails, the UDID is `NoUDID_`, followed by a random value from 0 to 1,000,000,000.

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Python**

```py
import random


def generate_udid(start: int = 100_000, end: int = 100_000_000) -> str:
    return "S15" + str(random.randint(start, end)) + str(random.randint(start, end)) + str(random.randint(start, end)) + str(random.randint(start, end))
```
