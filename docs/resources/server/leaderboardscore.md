# Server Leaderboard Score Resource

## Leaderboard Score

Leaderboards are the in-game ranking system for Geometry Dash. There are `7` types of leaderboards that are used as of version `2.11` 
> - `Star Top 100` - The top 100 best star grinders
> - `Star Friends` - The relative leaderboards between the user and his friends
> - `Relative Star` - The players position on the global leaderboards along with 100 other players that have a rank relative to the player
> - `Creator Top 100` - The top 100 creator point grinders
> - `Global Level Scores` - The fastest victors to a specific level since the level was uploaded to the servers
> - `Global Weekly Level Scores` - The fastest victors to a specific level since the last `604800` seconds
> - `Friend Level Scores` - The fastest victors to a specific level between the user and his friends since the level was uploaded to the servers

A typical leaderboard server response is structured with a `key:value:key:value` pairing and is then split with a `|`

Each `key` is tied to a component within the client and the `value` sets data for the specific component.  
A list of all known keys can be found in the table below
