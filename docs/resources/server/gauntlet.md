# Server Gauntlet Resource

## Gauntlet Info

Gauntlets are a collection of themed levels created by the users of Geometry Dash which were hand-picked by RobTop.

 - There are `27 gauntlets`
 - **A list of the Gauntlet Names can be found [here](/resources/server/gauntlet?id=gauntlet-names)**<br/>*Keep in mind that these are subject to change*

A typical gauntlet server response is structured with a `key:value:key:value` pairing and is then split with a `|`
<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Gauntlet Example Response**
```md
1:1:3:27732941,28200611,27483789,28225110,27448202|1:2:3:20635816,28151870,25969464,24302376,27399722 
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

Each `key` is tied to a component within the client and the `value` sets data for the specific component.  
A list of all known keys can be found in the table below

<!-- table made with a json to mdtable script so it looks ugky :/-->

### Trivia

- Gauntlets use the same response parser as [MapPacks](/resources/server/mappack) but they do not share the full range of features mappacks have
- The **Spike Gauntlet** used to be improperly capitalized in 2.1 as `spike` gauntlet
