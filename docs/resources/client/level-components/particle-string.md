# Particle String

The particle string is a long string of values separated by the `a` character that defines how particle systems in-game such as the particle object behave. Here is an example of a particle string:

```
30a-1a1.3a0.2a20a90a0a10a5a20a20a0a0a8a0a0a0a4a1a0a0a0a0a1a0a1a0a1a0a1a1a0a0a0 a0a0.784314a0a1a0a1a0a0.27a0a0.27a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a2a1a0a0a0a0a0a0a0.25a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0
```

(this is the particle string of the particles around the Mythic rating fire)
