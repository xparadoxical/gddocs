## List

A level list is a list of levels - playable objects in Geometry Dash, namely coming with data that explains on what this list is and which levels it contains. It is stored in [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) format, and each level entry is a dictionary, containing key/value pairs denoting the list's properties.
