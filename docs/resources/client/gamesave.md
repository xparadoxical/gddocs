# Client Gamesave Resource

> Gamesaves contain very important information regarding the players of Geometry Dash. This document will detail the data that can be found within a save file. For information regarding the decryption of save files, refer to the [Save Decryption][SAVE] section.

## Types of save files

There are 2 types of save files for Geometry Dash.

- CCGameManager
- CCLocalLevels

<!-- Todo: Plist section -->

These files contain a lot of data regarding a player and their levels. They are stored in an [Apple property list][PLIST] format

> On some platforms, special backup files called `CCGameManager2.dat` and `CCLocalLevels2.dat` are created with the intent of restoring save data in the event of save data corruption. Unfortunately, it rarely helps.
